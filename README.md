## Description
From previous course assigment project (https://github.com/Gronnfrosk/Course-Assignment-CSS-Frameworks/tree/bootstrap-and-sass) I have added the features listed down below. By using Noroff's API and API documentation, I created a functioning user interface that allows for viewing, posting, editing and deleting social media content. Social API routes require authorisation via JWT (JSON Web Tokens). One must register an account and login to access token which is stored in the localStorage.

### Goal: 
To apply knowledge of JavaScript techniques to implement the front-end functionality for a social media application.
#### Features added to this project:
- User with @noroff.no or @stud.noroff.no email can register profile
- Registered user can login
- User can view a post content feed
- User can filter the post content feed
- User can search the post content feed
- User can view a post content item by ID
- User can create a post content item
- User can update a post content item
- User can delete a post content item

1. Home page
2. Profile page
3. Login page
4. register page
